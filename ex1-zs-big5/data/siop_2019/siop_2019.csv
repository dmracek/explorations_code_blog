It doesn't make sense to cause workplace tensions over leisure activities. If I were to try and fight with my colleague over who gets to take vacation, it would only complicate our relationship and make things worse in the long run. I feel that by conceding, I not only avoid unnecessary tension, I improve my standing with my supervisor. If any conflicts arise in the future, I will be able to point to this particular incident to show that I had already made a concession and that other people will need to reciprocate to maintain fairness in the workplace.",I would work on the project as soon as possible and aim to complete it ahead of schedule. This allows me to double check the work in the event that no further tasks are assigned. It also ensures that I have ample time to complete additional tasks if my boss decides to give me something else during the two-week period in which I have to complete the project. I prefer to avoid procrastinating whenever possible for fear of having too much on my plate with little time to accomplish everything assigned to me.,"I would attend the meeting regardless of what my colleague decides to do. Although I may not know anyone at the meeting, the entire purpose of the event is to make myself known to other people. This increases my visibility in the organization and with the organization's clientele. Not only will I be able to ingratiate myself with our clients, I will be opening doors for opportunities in the future. In some ways, it is better if my colleague does not attend because it prevents me from spending too much time with people I already know and instead forces me to be gregarious and meet with new and unfamiliar faces instead.","I would ask my supervisor additional questions regarding my performance. I might consider arguing my perspective and trying to explain why I think the feedback might be unwarranted. I think the best course of action would be to simply grin and bear it, then spend time thinking over what was discussed in our conversation. Nobody is perfect, and this negative feedback could be a lesson on being a more humble and conscientious worker. I would undoubtedly be frustrated by the negative feedback at first, but after I've had time to process my emotions, I would likely try to take the feedback into consideration and work on making the necessary changes in order to avoid negative consequences at work.",I would find the experience to be enjoyable.

I would do this because there is no reason to be reasonable when the other party is being unreasonable and the real problem is that someone allowed the vacations to be scheduled at the same time in the first place.",I would finish the project.

The only thing I would feel is irritation.,This is not a binary choice. It doesn't have to be either enjoyable or boring. I don't think I would find this interesting which isn't the same as saying I would find it boring. Working with people far away means working with an obstacle. I don't want obstacles.

I would also try to anticipate my boss's last-minute demands by giving regular updates on my progress, and reiterating how important it is that I continue to work with the same guidelines and expectations for the final finished product.  If any changes did occur, I would have time to work on them, but I would have to stress that so much work had already been done, under the original guidelines.","I would still attend the networking event, even without my colleague.  If (s)he actually does attend, then I would probably stay for the whole event, and try to encourage this coworker to join me in networking.  If I was alone, however, I would still check out the event, but with considerably less enthusiasm.  This may turn out to be a valuable opportunity to meet with employees at the client company, but if early signs were not encouraging, I would just leave early.  It would be better for me to recharge for the next day at my job than to spend a weary night networking with people who are not interested in meeting me.","I would try, guardedly, to argue my own case in this situation.  If my boss offered specifics, I would try to offer some evidence to show that perhaps (s)he was being too negative with the feedback.  Perhaps the boss thought I wasn't contributing enough to a team project, but I had a lot of notes showing my work along the way.  I might also try to show how extenuating circumstances might have caused a poor performance despite my best efforts.  In sum, I would try to rebut this negative feedback, but only in a respectful, truthful, and evidence-based way.","I would find this experience enjoyable, even if the thought of actually traveling to Norway is not very attractive to me.  I do enjoy learning about other cultures, and coincidentally, I am already quite interested in Scandinavia.  I would volunteer for this project, and then find a travel documentary about Norway, and read some general history of the country online.

But if I was planning my vacation to coincide with a big event such as a wedding or graduation, I would tell my colleague that I would like to accept his or her generous offer to change their plans so that I could attend the event.","I would complete the project as soon as I could. I believe that my boss would appreciate me completing a project ahead of schedule as opposed to turning it in on the due date. Also, Murphy may turn up - what can go wrong will go wrong. So, I would use some ""Murphy repellent"" and complete the project early.","I would go. It really isn't important to me whether or not I know anyone else at the event.

If I were a client and had invited one of my suppliers to a networking meeting, I would want him or her to come with me.","I would first give the situation a lot of thought. I would ask myself if I could be wrong. Is it possible that my manager is right? If I'm convinced that my manager is wrong, I would ask myself why he or she holds the opinions that resulted in the feedback. I would perhaps discuss the situation with a trusted colleague that I respect. Finally, I would probably ask for another meeting with my manager to explain why I think his or her opinion about the situation is incorrect. If I don't change the manager's opinion, I would then decide whether or not to take further action (like talking to the manager's boss or even looking for another job) or to just put it behind me and move forward with my work.","I would definitely volunteer for this assignment.

However, I would not ""deliver"" the project until closer to the due date. In this way, I have built in the time to complete the project as best as I can, but have taken into account the likelihood of last minute additions. I would therefore take advantage of the light workload to get the project done in advance.","I would not go to the event because I do not do well at networking events.

Two weeks can go by very quickly and as my boss may give me a last minute task it is very important to do the project when my work is lighter.

I was a little miffed, but I understood the situation completely.","Again, this is something I have experienced in my current position. I never have a light workload, though. My boss' projects always take precedence over projects that I do for my coworkers.

I would not make a big issue out of it, as I am not a vacation person.  I would also take a 'spot me' payment, in the form of a free lunch, or other courtesy.","I would handle this situation by going to my boss daily, and talking to him or her.  I would explain my schedule and how I think things are coming along with the project.  I would then ask what he or she thinks the upcoming busy work looks like for the week ahead.","I would go, and make sure to put on a kind, professional face for the company.  I would, perhaps, explain that my colleague regrettably could not attend.  I would try to enjoy myself, because usually, I find that unexpected events turn out to be the most memorable.","I would be slightly angry about this situation.  However, I would ask as many questions as possible to get to the bottom of what I could do to improve.  I would ask my colleagues if they know anything afterward, and if they were evaluated in a similar manner, in order to gain more information.","I would find this situation very enjoyable and volunteer.  First, this is a great opportunity to advance your career.  However, I would first think far ahead, because you don't want to volunteer with too much on your plate at any one time.",3.25,3.6666666667,2.9166666667,3.25,3.0833333333,Dev
10449255347,"I would consider a lot of different things. Is this colleague somebody I like? Do I work with them regularly? Do I interact with them socially? Are they higher or lower than me in the organization. The week of vacation I requested, is there a reason I needed that specific week? Is it because my wife managed to get that time off? The answer to what I'd do largely depends on the answers to those questions. If I had flexibility I'd try to be a team player but if there would be little organizational blowback on me and my wife couldn't get other time off I'd probably fight for the time. Especially if I requested the time off.",If your boss has a tendency to throw unexpected work at you then it makes sense to plan around it with the expectation that it will likely occur. I would likely use my lighter workload in the present to work ahead on the project due in two weeks. In most jobs it's impossible to really project your workload perfectly so you take advantage of the low times to get ahead on things that may bite you later.,"I would attend the networking meeting, especially if your colleague isn't going. I would be up front with my colleague though, explaining that at least one of us should be there. They're a pain but often part of the job even if not explicitly required. It's hard to put a price on a solid client relationship.","I would passive aggressively update my resume and spend a little time looking for another job. I probably wouldn't act on it but it's nice to feel like I have options. And I frequently don't agree with negative feedback but it can still sometimes be right. At the very least, it means that somebody perceives you differently than you perceive yourself, so it can still be a good opportunity to reconsider how you perform your job. Is it wrong because somebody was missing information? Perception of performance is often more important than actual performance so even feedback you disagree with is very actionable. But also consider they may be making a paper trial to let you go. If you feel that's the case it's better to look for a job while you have one rather than wait until you're unemployed.","I would likely find this to be a positive experience. Honestly, the fact that it doesn't necessarily imply travel means that you likely could travel if you wanted to. Free trip to Norway. Broadening your experience at work is a good thing and if you're the only one with that expertise it makes you even more valuable. You're being paid to work and part of your compensation is by growing as an employee. Taking on a task that will reward you with new skills and expertise is always better than doing something routine, repetitive, and won't grow your expertise.",4,3.1666666667,4.5,4.0833333333,1.5833333333,Dev

I would not approach my coworker about it as it is not my place.","If the project is due in two weeks, but I feel that my boss is going to throw me a curb ball last minute, I would go ahead and start working on the project.

If my boss doesn't come up with any last minute tasks, then I'll have time to polish up my project. It never hurts to take a final look at it before I consider it truly completed. It works even better if I step away from it for a little while and then come back to it. I can see it from a different perspective. With a boss like this, you have to be prepared to be interrupted because you can't turn them down.","I would try to talk my colleague into going with me. I would do this by stressing the importance of the client and how it will look to our boss if we don't go. If my colleague decided to not go, in the end, I would go alone because I would feel obligated to go because this is one of the firm's largest clients and it would look bad if I didn't.","I would feel unappreciated and upset but I would wait until I cooled down before I did anything. Then I would gather the information to rebut what my boss said. If I have the data to back up my claim that his interpretation (or views) are incorrect, I would definitely   schedule a meeting with him/her and ask them to elaborate on their feedback while also explaining why I think they are wrong. I have no problem standing up for myself when I'm wrongly accused of something and this definitely falls into that category. I would feel that if I didn't respond and at least try to correct the situation, then it will happen again. Through the years, I've learned that bosses are not always right and that if you don't stand up to them and fight for yourself, they will think that they can say anything about your work and get away with it. It's the opposite of the squeaky wheel gets the grease. In this situation, if the boss knows that they can't just come out and say something without being able to back it up, then they will think twice about saying anything negative. Sometimes it's predator and prey. I've worked for bosses that would get in a bad mood and take it out on someone but if you stood up for yourself, they left you alone. I'm never the prey.","I would find this project incredibly enjoyable. I love to learn about different cultures so this would really be a fun experience for me. It would also look good on my CV because in today's world, if you are able to say you've worked with different cultures, it looks really good.

Consider the deadline as make or break situation that could end your career.  Take it as an opportunity and let go of the threatening aspect of the situation. When you do this, you put your skills to win the challenge.  Before starting the work itself, if you’re worried about the situation then you won’t put your best to the work. This negative thought drains out your energy and makes the task more challenging and difficult.","Be grateful: You are alone in the meeting, if you seek some query or help from others, don’t forget to say the magical works ‘Thank you’. By this you open the window to seek help again next time.  Be polite, calm and composed.. Don’t be too assertive or too defensive.. When you go to someone to talk, courteous enough to ask whether they are free and can spare few minutes. Don’t jump into every conversation without invitation. Be open to help","I take all feedback seriously, as it either directly addressees gaps/issues with my performance OR informs me what information gaps / misperceptions people may have about my performance. So, I do think it pays to listen fully.    If I disagree with the feedback, I don’t think it pays to be combative or defensive. I would look at it as an opportunity to clarity what the other person doesn’t know. So, for example, if someone told me they think I need to do a better job of communicating to Team ABC about a project — and I think I have done that well — I may reply something like, “would you mind if I walked you through my communications to that team to date, and you can help me identify what may have been unclear?”    So, turn it into a win-win. Either you clarify in that discussion that you did communicate well. OR, you get some more productive feedback that you originally received on how to tweak your work to be more effective.",Helping others has great benefits of helping the giver. It reinforces information needed to improve ones own life. It's satisfying feeling being part of the solution rather then the problem. Helps with self esteem. Opens doors to new possibilities that may not have presented itself otherwise. It's the moral and right thing to do. Sharing gifts you possess is part of why they are there in the first place.

My first response would be to ask for evidence of or basis for the feedback, doing my best to listen objectively although this would be difficult.  If I find that his negative comments were true, or if my previous actions could have been misconstrued in some way, I would apologize for the issue and discuss how I could remedy the problem.  On the off-chance that my boss does not present me with any evidence or examples, I would likely be heading down to HR to find out my options in the situation in the absence of any recourse offered by my own manager.","I would definitely volunteer for this project!  If there was a travel requirement I would have to pass, but in the absence of having to go to Norway, I would completely enjoy learning about the country and its culture.

I would take some time to objectively evaluate his observations, perhaps ask a co-worker, spouse or friend to provide their opinions, and if I continue to believe that I have been unfairly evaluated I would discuss my feelings with my supervisor, perhaps in the presence of another supervisor as mediator. Instead of reacting with anger and resentment, I would maintain my composure and professional demeanor and pursue the matter upward through the proper channels.  If I could not find a successful remedy I would strongly consider resigning.","I would immediately state my interest, with enthusiasm!
